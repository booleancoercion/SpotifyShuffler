# SpotifyShuffler

You know how Spotify's "shuffle" feature doesn't really play random songs from your playlists, but rather
the same small subset of songs accompanied by others that aren't even in the playlist to begin with?

I built this app to shuffle my playlists every day overnight, such that I can play them "in order"
every day and get something different!
